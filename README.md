Ojective: 
"Build and deploy a web application which lists all the pilots who recently violated the NDZ perimeter." 
-Persist the pilot information for 10 minutes since their drone was last seen by the equipment
-Display the closest confirmed distance to the nest
-Contain the pilot name, email address and phone number
-Immediately show the information from the last 10 minutes to anyone opening the application
-Not require the user to manually refresh the view to see up-to-date information
Status:
Everything works as it should and the app has some cool extra features for displaying the data.
